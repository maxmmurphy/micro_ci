= MicroCI - a real small continuos integration server for git projects 

MicroCI is intended to be a real small CI server with very few features that hopes to be very reliable

= Installation

git clone git://github.com/maxmmurphy/micro_ci.git

* Copy the config/projects.yml.example and modify it as needed save it as config/projects.yml
* Make a projects/ directory at the same level as your micro_ci application
* Make a builds/project_name directory that matches your project config
* clone the projects you added to the projects.yml making sure to keep the name the same as in the config
* check out the branch you want to be testing
* Make sure the rake tasks you want to run work in the project, ie set up the necessary gems, db, etc
* Ready to go! 

= Example Use

* make sure this runs successfully $> ruby micro_ci_cron.rb
* add a crontab entry to run the poller script every 5 minutes => */5 * * * * /home/adam/micro_ci_cron.rb

= Known issues

* can't run 2 or more instances of MicroCI on the same server
* need to clone repo for each separate branch you want to test
* will_paginate agnostic branch is frozen to vendor/gems until a better solution arises.
